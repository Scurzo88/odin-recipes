    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Start by preheating your oven to the recommended temperature specified in your pizza dough recipe or on the store-bought dough packaging. This is usually around 450°F (230°C) or higher for a crispy crust.</li>
        <li>Prepare the dough: If you are making your own dough, follow your chosen recipe to prepare the dough by combining flour, water, yeast, salt, and olive oil. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. If using store-bought dough, remove it from the packaging and let it rest at room temperature for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: On a floured surface, roll out the dough into your desired pizza shape and thickness. Use a rolling pin or your hands to stretch the dough evenly, making sure it doesn't tear.</li>
        <li>Prepare the toppings: Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded or sliced cheese over the sauce, and add your desired toppings, such as pepperoni, vegetables, or meats.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Transfer the topped pizza onto a baking sheet or a preheated pizza stone. Place it in the preheated oven and bake for the recommended time, usually around 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and serve: Carefully remove the pizza from the oven using oven mitts or a pizza peel. Allow it to cool for a few minutes before slicing it into wedges. Serve hot and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
