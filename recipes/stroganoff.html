    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        <li>Beef Broth</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the sliced beef and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed, and saut√© the sliced onions until they become soft and translucent. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown.</li>
        <li>Return the cooked beef to the pan with the onions and mushrooms. Stir everything together to combine.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low. Pour in the beef broth, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir well to incorporate the flavors.</li>
        <li>Simmer the mixture for about 5-10 minutes, allowing the beef to become tender and the flavors to meld together. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper as desired.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the sour cream. Gently cook the mixture for another 2-3 minutes, making sure not to let it boil. The sour cream will thicken the sauce and give it a creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat. Your Stroganoff is now ready to be served.</li>
        <li>Serve the Stroganoff over a bed of cooked egg noodles, rice, or mashed potatoes. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or dill for an extra touch of freshness.</li>
    </ol>
